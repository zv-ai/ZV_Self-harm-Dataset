# ZV_Self-harm-Dataset
## Dataset Description
The ZV_Self-harm Dataset is a self-harm dataset developed by ZIOVISION. It consists of 1,120 videos. Professional actors were hired to simulate self-harm behaviors, and the scenes were recorded using four cameras to ensure full coverage without blind spots.
Self-harm behaviors in the dataset are limited to "cutting" actions targeting specific body parts. The designated self-harm areas include the wrists, forearms, and thighs.
